We will use a generator so we do not process multiple times the same data :
sample 1 includes day 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
sample 2 includes day 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

data : normalized data
lookback : how far we go in the past (5 days) for each label, number of samples for each label (2 : 2 samples for each label)
delay : how many timesteps in the future the target should be (0 : next sample, 1 : two samples away)
min/max_index : delimits the timeframe in the data that we will get data from (useful for delimiting data sets)
shuffle : shuffles the data or keep it in chronological order
batch_size : number of samples per batch, how many series it will return
step : number of timesteps to sample data (6 * 10 minutes = 1 data point per hour), effectively it returns one sample
out of step samples (2 : returns the 1st sample, third sample, fifth sample)
